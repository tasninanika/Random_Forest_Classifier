# ðŸŒ² Random Forest Classifier - Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates how to use the **Random Forest Classifier** â€” a powerful ensemble learning algorithm â€” to classify data accurately and reliably. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and is evaluated using accuracy and prediction results.

## ðŸ§  What is Random Forest?

**Random Forest** is a **supervised machine learning** algorithm that uses a collection of decision trees to make predictions. It combines the output of multiple trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

It works by:
- Creating multiple **decision trees** using different subsets of the data
- Making predictions from each tree
- Taking a **majority vote** (for classification) or average (for regression) as the final result

This method increases performance and handles noisy or missing data better than a single decision tree.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Preprocess the data (if needed)  
3. Split data into training and test sets  
4. Train the model using `RandomForestClassifier`  
5. Predict outcomes on the test set  
6. Measure model accuracy  
7. Visualize feature importance or confusion matrix
